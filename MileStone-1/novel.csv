The villagers spoke of the fog in hushed tones, and some even swore that it hid things—things that could not be seen in daylight, or touched in the waking world. But Mara, ever the skeptic, believed the fog was just fog. Nothing more.

One evening, as the fog gathered thicker than usual, Mara noticed a soft glow in the distance. It was faint at first, but it grew brighter as she watched. The light was coming from the cliff’s edge, where no lanterns were ever kept. No one ever went up there. But tonight, something—someone—was there.

Mara’s curiosity, like the fog, thickened. Without thinking, she grabbed her coat and stepped into the mist, the lantern in her hand casting a feeble circle of warmth around her. The air felt colder than usual, as if the fog had a life of its own, reaching and pulling at her ankles.

The path to the cliff was long and winding, and every step seemed to stretch farther than it should have. The light in the distance flickered but remained steady, leading her onward.

When she reached the top, Mara stopped dead in her tracks.

There, standing at the edge of the cliff, was a figure in a long cloak. The cloak shimmered, as if made from the very mist itself. The figure turned slowly, and Mara’s heart skipped a beat when she saw its face. It was not a person at all, but a mask—smooth and pale, with hollow eyes that seemed to look right through her.

"Who are you?" Mara called, her voice trembling despite her best efforts.
